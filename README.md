📘 Week 1: Complex Numbers

Topics Covered:
	•	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
	•	Classes and Objects
	•	Method Overloading and Overriding
	•	Interfaces (Comparable, Cloneable)

Description:
Implements a Complex class for performing arithmetic operations on complex numbers
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and comparing magnitudes.

Example Output:

Enter a and b for the complex number a + bi: 3 4
Enter c and d for the complex number c + di: 1 2

c1 = 3.0 + 4.0i and c2 = 1.0 + 2.0i
c1 + c2 = 4.0 + 6.0i
c1 - c2 = 2.0 + 2.0i
c1 * c2 = -5.0 + 10.0i
c1 / c2 = 2.2 - 0.4i
|c1| = 5.0
